This is a repository to complain basic concept of ML and its categories

## ðŸ‘‹ **OVERVIEW OF ML**
---
Machine learning is a subfield of computer science(http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1116194/machine-learning) that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. Machine learning explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from
example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions, rather than following strictly static program instructions.


## ðŸ¤“ **TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING** 
---

### ðŸš€ SUPERVISED LEARNING
In supervised machine learning, there is a training data to feed the ML algorithms which includes the desired solution called labals.

**Note** 

Supervised ML is classified into two. These are;
1. Classification
2. Regression 

### ðŸš€ UNSUPERVISED LEARNING 
In unsupervised learning, no labels are given to the
learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. 

### ðŸš€ REINFORNCEMENT LEARNING
Reinforcement learning means a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must
perform a certain goal 

### ðŸš€ SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING 
In this ML, some algorithms can deal with partly labeled training data usually a lot of unlabelled data and a bit of labelled data.

Some photo-hosting services such as google photos are good examples of this
